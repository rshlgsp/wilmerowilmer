             <h1>BREATHE!</h1>
             <p> Let me begin by praising you for all of your hard work and determination. Your dedication to your education and, at the same time, to our relationship has been admirable. You may be exhausted and anxious today and in the following days, but always remember that all of your hard effort will be rewarded. Always remember to breathe and rest, and to look after oneself. Put as much emphasis on your physical and mental well-being as you do on your activities. Take your time to breathe and relax. Always smile and begin each day with a positive attitude; don't allow the bad days get the better of you; always bring out the best in yourself. You can do it; all you have to do is breathe.</p>
